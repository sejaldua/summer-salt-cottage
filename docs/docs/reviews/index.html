<blockquote>
<p>We were very impressed with the house and the location. Great layout, very comfortable beds, everything in excellent condition. We had 8 people in our group, 6 adults and 2 children. I would highly recommend this beach house!</p>

<h4 id="stunning-new-beach-house-in-manzanita-">Stunning new beach house in Manzanita!! ★★★★★</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow! Far exceeded my expectations. I was looking for a nice remodeled home that had a beach vibe. I just needed to check out for a few days at the coast. I wanted all the amenities of a nice hotel yet I wanted the charm of a &ldquo;beach house&rdquo;. This one Absolutely fit the bill! Beautiful interior decor, tons of living space for families and friends. I loved the master and spa like bath, nicely appointed at one side of the home for privacy. The backyard was enchanting with the garden and fire pit area for telling stories and making smores. We easily could walk to the beach and all the delicious local eats. It was the best beach experience I have had. I would highly recommend this home to anyone wanting a special experience at the coast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had booked this property last on my itinerary and was sort of lukewarm about it simply from the pictures. But was I ever wrong &ndash; the place is just amazing, and it turned out to be the best part of my trip. The Summer Salt Cottage is a ranch (single level) property in tiny Manzanita, and it is beautifully furnished and well stocked. There is a ton of room, and the amenities are top notch. The property is also just 1.5 blocks from a drop-dead gorgeous beach, with easy access to pizza, coffee, and good pastries. What more could a boy want?</p>

<h4 id="best-vrbo-i-have-ever-rented-">Best VRBO I have ever rented ★★★★★</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We use VRBO a lot and this is by far the nicest place we have ever stayed at. It is beautiful, clean&hellip;so so clean and has everything you could possibly want and good quality things. They had toys for the kids, books for everyone, anything you could possibly want in the kitchen. I really can&rsquo;t say enough good stuff about this place. The location is very convenient being one block from beach and 2 blocks for town. I will absolutely be staying here again. The only thing I could think of that they could possibly add was a pack and play but maybe they had that and I didn&rsquo;t see it. We actually sat around the firepit in the lovely rocking chairs trying to think of something they maybe forgot. So well appointed and beautiful. We had a lovely time thank you. We will be back next year&hellip;if it isn&rsquo;t sold out. :)</p>
