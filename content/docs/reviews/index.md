#### Rave review! ★★★★★

> We were very impressed with the house and the location. Great layout, very comfortable beds, everything in excellent condition. We had 8 people in our group, 6 adults and 2 children. I would highly recommend this beach house!

#### Stunning new beach house in Manzanita!! ★★★★★

> Wow! Far exceeded my expectations. I was looking for a nice remodeled home that had a beach vibe. I just needed to check out for a few days at the coast. I wanted all the amenities of a nice hotel yet I wanted the charm of a "beach house". This one Absolutely fit the bill! Beautiful interior decor, tons of living space for families and friends. I loved the master and spa like bath, nicely appointed at one side of the home for privacy. The backyard was enchanting with the garden and fire pit area for telling stories and making smores. We easily could walk to the beach and all the delicious local eats. It was the best beach experience I have had. I would highly recommend this home to anyone wanting a special experience at the coast.
