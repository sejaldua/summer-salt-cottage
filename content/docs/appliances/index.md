## Microwave / Oven

Sometimes there will be a power failure on the Oven (after a long period of non use). If this happens, go to the electric panel in the garage and flip the breaker labeled “Oven”. Flip it all the way to the right and then all the way to the left. You will see an indicator at the Oven showing it is rebooting.

The oven has a microwave on top and a regular oven at bottom. Select the function and time you want – it looks fancy but is very intuitive.

## Ice Maker

**THE ICEMAKER IS OUT**. Do not use the water dispenser or ice maker in the fridge as a result. (We are ordering a new fridge but the wait time is months out right now). Please use the ice cube trays for ice. The tap water tastes fantastic.

## Grill

There is a propane grill in the garage. **PLEASE DO NOT USE IT IN THE GARAGE**. Roll it out to use it and then do not cover it and roll it back until it is completely cooled down. You are responsible for filling the propane tank if it is needed (you can get propane at Little Manzanita grovery store or at the larger grocery store at the end of Laneda Ave).
