Our house is equipped with Sonos speakers. Here are the steps to use the speaker system:

1. Connect to our home internet. Wifi credentials can be found [here](https://summersaltcottage.info/docs/wifi/index.md)
2. Download the Sonos app
3. Login to your own Sonos account and then your desired streaming accounts. 
4. If you do not have a Sonos account, you can treat the speakers like good old Bluetooth speakers.
