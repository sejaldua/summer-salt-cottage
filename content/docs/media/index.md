We have lots of books, games, and a Wii game controller in the bonus room (there is a sleeper sofa there too). Enjoy everything and please leave it the way it was for the next guest. (Note: most of the books and games are labeled but some are not). Directions for the Wii game are in a manual in the desk in the living room.
